This is a HTML5 browser-based client for the game Netrek.  It includes client
files and a WebSocket-to-TCP proxy.  (This should be replaced with websockify
ASAP, since it keeps crashing whenever errors happen on the client.)  The
proxy must run somewhere in order for the client to connect, since a browser
cannot directly connect to a raw Netrek TCP server/socket.

The code is mainly in /lib at the moment:
world - handles user input and manages all objects in the game
outfitting - draws the outfitting screen and sends/receives relevant net info
ship - represents a ship; information send to a ship object is used to update
       its local and tactical graphics
net - makes connections, reads the data stream, and performs virtually all
      server-driven action.  Includes objects for many types of messages.
